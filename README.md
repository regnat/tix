% tix
% A (wip) type-inference engine for [nix](https://nixos.org/nix)

There is currently not much, hardly a parser for a small subset of the language.

# Build

Assuming you got nix installed on your computer, run `nix-shell` to enter a
well-configured environment, and then:

```
$ make configure
$ make
$ make test
```
